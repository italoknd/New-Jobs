# New Jobs

This is a simple project (so far) using Vue and Typescript.

## Explaining the project:
Basically it's a list of jobs that appears to the user, and he/she can order these jobs by some categories which is: title, location or salary
In the future I intend to add some features like, add images for each job, make a section where to update new jobs, (maybe a login for each user (?))
Add a real database for save these datas and so on...
